# badri-bookmark-app

Kind of ran out of time before being able to really hit the CSS! I apologize... looks pretty boring with some rushed last-minute CSS decorations/

I do not think I handled errors correctly... can attempt to update if necessary. Just ran out of time!



I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title
url link
description
rating (1-5)

I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
